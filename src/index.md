My name is Oscar, I’m 7 1/2 years old and I really like making origami. These Christmas Stars are special because they’re made with sheet music that my grandma, my great grandma, and my great-great grandmas all used to teach piano. I’m selling them as Gift Toppers and Christmas Tree Ornaments for $3 each or 2/$5. I will hand deliver to your front door in my neighborhood or I can mail them to you for a small extra price. You can message my mom on here or email Ox@Oxigami.com to make an order. Thank you! Happy Holidays!
