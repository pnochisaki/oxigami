My name is Oscar, I’m 7 1/2 years old and I really like making origami. These Christmas Stars are special because they’re made with sheet music that my grandma, my great grandma, and my great-great grandmas all used to teach piano. I’m selling them as Gift Toppers and Christmas Tree Ornaments for $2.50. I will hand deliver to your front door in my neighborhood or I can mail them to you for a small extra price. Thank you! Happy Holidays!
